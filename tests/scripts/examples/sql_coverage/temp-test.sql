-- Test ORDER BY, especially with DESC
select * from _table ORDER BY ID
select * from _table ORDER BY ID ASC

select ID, NUM from _table   ORDER BY ID
select ID, NUM from _table   ORDER BY ID ASC
select ID, NUM from _table   ORDER BY ID DESC
select ID, NUM from _table   ORDER BY ID, NUM DESC
select ID, NUM from _table T ORDER BY T.ID DESC, T.NUM DESC
select ID, NUM from _table T ORDER BY T.ID DESC
select ID, NUM from _table   ORDER BY ID DESC
select ID, NUM from _table   ORDER BY ID DESC, NUM DESC
select ID, NUM from _table   ORDER BY NUM DESC, ID DESC
